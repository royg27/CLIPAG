> **Abstract:** *Perceptually Aligned Gradients (PAG) refer to an intriguing property observed in robust image classification models, wherein their input gradients align with human perception and pose semantic meanings. While this phenomenon has gained significant research attention, it was solely studied in the context of unimodal vision-only architectures. 
In this work, we extend the study of PAG to Vision-Language architectures, which form the foundations for diverse image-text tasks and applications.
Through an adversarial robustification finetuning of CLIP, we demonstrate that robust Vision-Language models exhibit PAG in contrast to their vanilla counterparts.
This work reveals the merits of CLIP with PAG (CLIPAG) in several vision-language generative tasks. Notably, we show that seamlessly integrating CLIPAG in a ``plug-n-play'' manner leads to substantial improvements in vision-language generative applications. 
Furthermore, leveraging its PAG property, CLIPAG enables text-to-image generation without any generative model, which typically requires huge generators.*

### Boosting CLIPDraw
The entire code for enhancing CLIPDraw using CLIPAG is contained in a single self-contained jupiter notebook - `CLIPAG+CLIPDraw.ipynb`.
We recommend running it using Google Colab to facilitate the environment installation.
